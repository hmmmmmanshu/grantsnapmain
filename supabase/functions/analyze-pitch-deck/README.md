## üîê Authentication

The function requires a valid JWT token from Supabase Auth in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

## üß† AI Integration

### Current Implementation
The function currently uses mock responses for demonstration purposes. To integrate with real AI services:

1. **Replace the `callAIModel` function** with your preferred AI service
2. **Update environment variables** with your AI service API keys
3. **Customize the prompt engineering** for your specific use case

### Example AI Service Integration
```typescript
// OpenAI Integration Example
async function callAIModel(prompt: string): Promise<string> {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${Deno.env.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: 'gpt-4',
      messages: [{ role: 'user', content: prompt }],
      max_tokens: 1000,
      temperature: 0.3,
    }),
  })
  
  const data = await response.json()
  return data.choices[0].message.content
}
```

## üìÑ Document Processing

### Supported Formats
- **PDF**: Uses pdf-parse library (currently mocked)
- **PowerPoint**: Uses mammoth library (currently mocked)
- **File Size Limit**: 50MB maximum

### Text Extraction
The function extracts raw text from documents and processes it through AI analysis to generate structured summaries.

### AI Analysis Prompt
The function uses sophisticated prompt engineering to extract key business information:

1. **Problem Statement**: What problem is the startup solving?
2. **Solution Overview**: What is their solution/product?
3. **Target Market**: Who is their target market/customer?
4. **Business Model**: How do they make money?
5. **Team Strengths**: What are the key team strengths/credentials?
6. **Key Metrics & Traction**: What traction, metrics, or progress have they shown?
7. **Funding Ask**: What funding are they seeking and for what purpose?

## üîí Security Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Validates user tokens
- **File Size Validation**: Enforces 50MB limit
- **File Type Validation**: Only allows PDF and PowerPoint files
- **User Isolation**: Users can only analyze their own uploaded files
- **CORS Support**: Configured for web application access
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error responses and logging

## üß™ Testing

### Using cURL
```bash
curl -X POST https://[PROJECT_REF].supabase.co/functions/v1/analyze-pitch-deck \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [USER_JWT_TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "file_path": "user-uuid/pitch-deck-1234567890.pdf",
    "file_name": "startup-pitch-deck.pdf",
    "file_size": 2048576
  }'
```

### Using JavaScript
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://[PROJECT_REF].supabase.co/functions/v1/analyze-pitch-deck', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    file_path: 'user-uuid/pitch-deck-1234567890.pdf',
    file_name: 'startup-pitch-deck.pdf',
